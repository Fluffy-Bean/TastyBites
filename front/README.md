# TastyBites Frontend

The Frontend is written in Svelte using the Svelte-SPA-Router plugin to create
"fake" routes, as using a javascript backend would make me wanna game end. As Go can include
files, you simply need to compile the front end by running `npm run build` or `go generate front/embed.go`.
