# Design Files

This folder contains all the files I used during the design of this website,
this includes the wireframes, mockups, and other screenshots and stuff.

To read the excalidraw files, visit https://excalidraw.com and import the raw file,
there you should be able to view all the stuff I have done. As excalidraw has a 2MB file
size limit, I probably split some stuff up into separate files (that should be named correctly)
